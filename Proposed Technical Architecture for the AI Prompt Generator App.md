# Proposed Technical Architecture for the AI Prompt Generator App

This document outlines the recommended technical stack for building the AI prompt generator app. The selection of technologies is based on the following criteria:

*   **Free and Open-Source:** All recommended tools have generous free tiers or are completely open-source, eliminating any financial barriers.
*   **Beginner-Friendly:** The chosen technologies have a relatively low learning curve and extensive documentation, making them suitable for developers of all skill levels.
*   **Scalability:** The stack is designed to be scalable, allowing the application to grow in features and user base over time.

## Frontend

*   **Framework:** **React** will be used as the frontend framework. It is a popular and versatile choice with a large community, extensive documentation, and a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. Its component-based architecture will allow for the creation of a modular and maintainable user interface.
*   **UI Library:** **Material-UI (MUI)** will be used for the user interface components. MUI provides a set of pre-built, customizable, and responsive React components that follow Google's Material Design guidelines. This will help in creating a modern and visually appealing UI with minimal effort.

## Backend

*   **Framework:** **Flask** will be used as the backend framework. Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that is easy to learn and use. It is an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs, which will be needed to handle requests from the frontend.

## Database

*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** will be used as the database. It is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. We will use a free tier from a cloud provider.

## User Authentication

*   **Service:** **Keycloak** will be used for user authentication and authorization. Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides features like single sign-on (SSO), social login, and user federation. It will handle all the complexities of user management, allowing us to focus on the core features of the application.

## AI Prompt Generation

*   **API:** We will use the **OpenAI API** to generate the prompts. The free tier of the OpenAI API will be sufficient for the initial version of the application.

## Deployment

*   **Frontend:** The frontend will be deployed as a static website on **Netlify**. Netlify offers a generous free tier for hosting static sites and provides features like continuous deployment from a Git repository.
*   **Backend:** The backend API will be deployed on **Render**. Render provides a free tier for hosting web services, which is perfect for our Flask application.
*   **Database:** The PostgreSQL database will be hosted on **Render** as well, which offers a free tier for PostgreSQL databases.
